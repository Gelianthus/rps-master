## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Figuring out the logic was the easy part, what gave me the most trouble is having to use images that needs to be positioned absolutely. I always have trouble dealing with images because I always end up declaring a height and width for them. This could be double the workload once you start to make everything responsive.

### Continued development

The project is unfinished in a sense that the screen responsiveness isn't perfect. I'll continue to learn how to properly use media queries to deal with responsiveness. But most importantly, learn how to make a good layout to make it easier to configure the responsiveness of a site.
